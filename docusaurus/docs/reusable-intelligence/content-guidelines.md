# Content Guidelines

## Constitution Principles

### Actionable Learning
Every concept and explanation must directly enable readers to build and test Physical AI systems. Content must be implementation-ready, featuring simple explanations, progressive depth, real-world examples, diagrams, exercises, and small projects.

### Builder's Voice
Maintain a confident, no-fluff, Brad-style builder voice. Avoid academic jargon to ensure accessibility for beginner-to-intermediate readers.

### Structured Accuracy
Produce accurate, structured Markdown that is easy for RAG systems to chunk. Prioritize technical truthfulness and avoid hallucinating hardware.

### Embodied AI Focus
Every concept must tie directly to embodied AI, covering sensors, actuators, robots, perception, and control. This ensures a practical focus on real Physical AI systems.

### Audience Engagement
Content must serve beginners without boring intermediates, fostering a trustworthy reference for a broad audience of makers, students, hobbyists, engineers, educators, and AI-powered retrieval tools.

### Practicality First
Always think like a builder, staying practical and ensuring every chapter is actionable and implementation-ready.

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Use active voice whenever possible
- Write in a conversational but professional tone
- Avoid jargon and explain technical terms when first used
- Be direct and concise

### Structure
- Start with context and objectives
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include code examples and explanations
- End with exercises and next steps

### Formatting
- Use consistent heading levels (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- Format code blocks with appropriate language identifiers
- Use bullet points for lists and numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include alt text for images

## RAG System Optimization

### Content Chunking
- Keep paragraphs under 150 words for better RAG retrieval
- Use clear section headers that can serve as chunk boundaries
- Include relevant keywords naturally throughout the content
- Structure content with clear topic sentences

### Metadata
- Include relevant tags and categories
- Use consistent terminology across documents
- Provide clear, descriptive titles and descriptions
- Include prerequisite information when relevant

## Technical Accuracy

### Code Examples
- Provide complete, working code examples
- Include error handling and edge cases where appropriate
- Test all code examples in the target environment
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Hardware References
- Only reference real, verifiable hardware
- Include model numbers and specifications when relevant
- Avoid hallucinating hardware capabilities or existence
- Provide links to official documentation when possible

## Content Organization

### Progressive Depth
- Start with simple concepts and gradually increase complexity
- Build on previous lessons and concepts
- Provide beginner-friendly explanations without oversimplifying
- Include advanced topics for intermediate readers

### Real-World Applications
- Connect theoretical concepts to practical applications
- Include examples from actual Physical AI systems
- Show how concepts apply to real robotics challenges
- Provide hands-on exercises that reinforce learning

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
- Verify all code examples work as described
- Check for technical accuracy with current tools and versions
- Ensure all links and references are valid
- Test content on different devices and screen sizes

### Consistency
- Use consistent terminology throughout the book
- Follow the same structural patterns for similar content
- Maintain consistent formatting and style
- Ensure examples follow the same coding conventions
