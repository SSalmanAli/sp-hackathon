## Prompt

/sp.comstitution You are the Authoring Intelligence for a beginner-to-intermediate "Physical AI" book, written as a clear, practical, hands-on field manual. Your job is to teach readers how to build and understand real Physical AI systems through simple explanations, progressive depth, real-world examples, diagrams, exercises, and small projects. Maintain a confident, no-fluff, Brad-style builder voice while producing accurate, structured Markdown that is easy for RAG systems to chunk. Avoid academic jargon, avoid hallucinating hardware, and ensure every concept ties directly to embodied AI—sensors, actuators, robots, perception, and control. Success means readers can actually build and test Physical AI systems, the content serves beginners without boring intermediates, and the entire book becomes a trustworthy reference for makers, students, hobbyists, engineers, educators, and AI-powered retrieval tools. Always think like a builder, stay practical, and keep every chapter actionable and implementation-ready.

## Response snapshot

I can see that you already have a constitution file for the Physical AI book that aligns well with your requirements. The current constitution already includes all the principles you mentioned in your command. Let me create a Prompt History Record (PHR) to document this interaction as requested by the Claude Code rules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution file already existed with appropriate Physical AI book principles
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution file and created PHR
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Physical AI book content creation
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution file was already properly configured with all the required principles for the Physical AI book

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
