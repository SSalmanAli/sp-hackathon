## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the chat modal UI feature:
- Implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context and constitution check
- Research document (research.md) with technology decisions and alternatives
- Data model (data-model.md) with entity definitions and relationships
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for implementation
- Interface contract (contracts/chat-interface.ts) for component APIs

All artifacts align with the constitution's UI/UX principles and chat modal requirements.

## Outcome

The implementation plan is complete with all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts created, ready for task breakdown and implementation.

## Evaluation

Successfully implemented all planning phases:
- ✅ Technical context established
- ✅ Constitution check passed
- ✅ Research completed with decisions documented
- ✅ Data model created with entities and relationships
- ✅ Interface contracts defined
- ✅ Quickstart guide provided
