# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Actionable Learning
Every concept and explanation must directly enable readers to build and test Physical AI systems. Content must be implementation-ready, featuring simple explanations, progressive depth, real-world examples, diagrams, exercises, and small projects.

### II. Builder's Voice
Maintain a confident, no-fluff, Brad-style builder voice. Avoid academic jargon to ensure accessibility for beginner-to-intermediate readers.

### III. Structured Accuracy
Produce accurate, structured Markdown that is easy for RAG systems to chunk. Prioritize technical truthfulness and avoid hallucinating hardware.

### IV. Embodied AI Focus
Every concept must tie directly to embodied AI, covering sensors, actuators, robots, perception, and control. This ensures a practical focus on real Physical AI systems.

### V. Audience Engagement
Content must serve beginners without boring intermediates, fostering a trustworthy reference for a broad audience of makers, students, hobbyists, engineers, educators, and AI-powered retrieval tools.

### VI. Practicality First
Always think like a builder, staying practical and ensuring every chapter is actionable and implementation-ready.

## Content Standards

Content must be free of academic jargon. All hardware references must be real and verifiable; no hallucinated hardware. Every concept must link directly to embodied AI components: sensors, actuators, robots, perception, and control. Focus on simple, clear explanations that gradually increase in depth, supported by practical examples, diagrams, exercises, and small projects.

## Writing Process

Chapters should be designed to be actionable and implementation-ready. Content should be structured for easy consumption by both human readers and RAG systems, ensuring clear chunking and discoverability. Continuous review to ensure content serves beginners effectively while remaining engaging for intermediate readers.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and guidelines for the "Physical AI" book. All content creation, editing, and review processes must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require a documented rationale and a consensus among the authoring intelligence and human collaborators. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and the continued delivery of high-quality, actionable content.
